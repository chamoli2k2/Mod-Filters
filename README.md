# 🧮 Filter Dashboard

A dynamic React-based dashboard that loads CSV data, allows multi-criteria filtering (including custom modulo filtering), and displays the results in a paginated data table. Built for scalability and responsiveness.

## 🚀 Features

- 📄 Load CSV dataset dynamically
- 🧠 Intelligent dropdown filters for each column
- ➗ Custom modulo filter for numerical operations
- 🔢 Supports large datasets with optimized rendering
- 📊 Paginated and sortable data table
- 🎨 Responsive dark-themed UI

## 🖥️ Tech Stack

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [PapaParse](https://www.papaparse.com/) – CSV parsing
- [react-select](https://react-select.com/) – for filter dropdowns
- [react-data-table-component](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-data-table-component) – for rendering data tables
- Tailwind CSS – for styling

## 📦 Installation

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/filter-dashboard.git
   cd filter-dashboard
````

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Add your CSV file (e.g., `dataset_large.csv`) to the `public` folder.

4. Run the app:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   Your app will be available at `http://localhost:5173` (or as shown in your terminal).

## 🧪 Usage

* Each column is filterable with multi-select dropdowns.
* Enter a modulo base (e.g., 5), then select remainders to filter numeric data based on `number % base`.
* Data updates dynamically based on selected filters.

## ⚠️ Notes

* Ensure your CSV contains a numeric column titled `number` for modulo filtering to work correctly.
* For large `modBase` values, loading dropdowns may take time. Consider limiting input or optimizing with virtualization libraries.
